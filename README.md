# **The Wild Hunt**  
The Wild Hunt is a datapack that turns Minecraft into an all-vs-one PvP minigame.  
Everyone except one player becomes a Hunter. That lone individual is the Prey.  
- **Prey:** Survive for 15 minutes while being hunted and the border closes in.  
- **Hunter:** Work together to hunt the Prey.  

If the **Hunters kill** the **Prey**, they win and move to the **next round**.  
If the **Prey survives** until **time runs out**, everyone moves into the **next round**.  

The prey will be announced to the hunters after 2.5 minuites
